# Bupropion-DDGI-Model
Modeling of published clinical Bupropion studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body parent-metabolite PBPK models for Bupropion (and its metabolites Hydroxybupropion, Erythorhydrobupropion and Threohydrobupropion). The model was developed using published clinical studies and its predicted performance evaluated within our DDI network. The file Bupropion-Model contains simulations of the published clinical studies used during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports.For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/3/331)]. The DDI files contain simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the bupropion model regarding the rifampicin-bupropion-DD(G)I and the fluvoxamine-voriconazole-bupropion-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied rifampicin, fluvoxamine and voricoazole models have been published previously [[2](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/psp4.12343)-[4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40262-019-00856-z)].
